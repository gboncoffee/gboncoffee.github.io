# I'm Not Trying to Seduce You

I write. And I do write for people. And for people I write about weird shit I
think. Because it's fun. For people, I write about weird things I feel. After
all, everyone does. I just have no shame about it. And I'll write so everybody
knows. I'm still human. And I'll write about my human nature. I'm still to
overcome it. But in the meanwhile, I'll write about the weird way it goes.

I'm not trying to seduce you.
