# Nothing That Silicon Can't Solve

They said they were  
Here all for ya bass  
And they told ya they  
Wished no more treble  
And then as you would go  
They started to change their mind  
And then they went on  
Talking shit from ya behind  

They told ya they include  
But ya may had fallen behind  
They make shit up while  
Hoping for ya demise  
Ya would go on with your  
Drugs, your life, your side  
But when the libido gets  
Ya, good friend of mine  

My friend, I tell ya  
Go on with the robots this night  
Because pleasure is pleasure and  
That’s nothing that silicon can’t solve  
Tonight
