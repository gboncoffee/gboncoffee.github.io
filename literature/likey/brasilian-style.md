# Brasilian Style

Let the heat  
Let the heat  
Flow down  
Down with the water, down  
Down with the water  
Free all of your thoughts  
And let them all  
Down on the pipe, down  
Down on the pipe  

Anyway you may cut it, just throw all in the pipe  
Let the water free all of it in a Brasilian Style  

Feel all the heat in your exposed skin  
And let free of your thoughts within  

Falling,  
And falling  
Down with the soap  
And the hot fresh water that carries your scent  

Falling,  
And falling  
Down with the chains  
And the blanket that covers all of your face  

Cut, cut it  
Let it flow down with the heat  
All of what disagree with your brighter side  

Clean, clean it  
Pour the water in the skin  
Let in your body only what you think is nice
