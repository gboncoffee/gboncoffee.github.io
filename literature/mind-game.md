# Mind Game

I had a nightmare during the storm  
But they went away today  
It’s like a miracle that I had woke up  
From that endless devil prank  

I saw a silhouette worth of remembering  
But I forgot about it anyway  
It lied to me a lot of beautiful lies  
And kept my whole mind blank  

I woke up in the middle of the night  
From the sleep that have never arrived  
Now  
I’m going down to the endless bed  

Mind game  
Keeping me awake at night  
Keeping my sleep from the arrive  
Now  
I’m going down to the endless bed  

I had a nightmare during the Sun  
But it melted away today  
It’s like a miracle that the Sun still shines  
With that amount of rain  

I went out just to contemplate the sky  
As the rainbow appeared there up high  
Know  
I that with no rain there’s no rainbow  

Hope stays  
As I go to contemplate the sky  
While the rain do stay on it’s fall  
Know  
I that with no rain there’s no rainbow
