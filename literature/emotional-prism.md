# Emotional Prism

Your Love is  
Truly a wonderful fantasy  
As your love would make  
My heartbeat rise right up  

To sleep or not to sleep right now?  
(Sweetheart loved)  
To think or not to think on you now?  
(Precious one)  

I remember seeing your  
Fluffy light hair passing by  
As I was thinking about  
The dream of your lips touching mine  

To forget it or not to forget shall I?  
(Angel girl)  
Shall I put myself on my place, shall?  
(Precious one)  

Your Love is  
Truly a wonderful fantasy  
As your Love could make  
All my dreams come true  

Too pretty for me is you, shall say?  
(Crystal girl)  
Too greedy am I wanting you, nay?  
(Precious one)  

I wanna be with you  
All of my life with you  
Looking through your eyes  
I wanna be with you  
I would live to you  
Deep into your eyes  
I wanna be with you  
I wanna kiss just you  
And see just your eyes
