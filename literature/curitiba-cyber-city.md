# Curitiba Cyber City

At seven PM the pitch writing is the urban art  
I listen to old school metal on my way home  
This time in town, the parties just started  
But my bus driver just wants to meet his wife  

Back from the campus, I take an hour by bus  
I see the other students drinking and kissing  
As this liquid love spreads through the sewage  
Maybe they know the future that I'm studying  

As the math that creates my music is computed  
It merges with the sound that the city produces  
Too much people are screaming of pain and love  
Their voices are muted when an ambulance passes  

In this environment, we don't know who we are  
But I can ensure that we know who we want to be  
In this Cyber City, what connects us is a wire  
Even if you want to be a wireless human being
