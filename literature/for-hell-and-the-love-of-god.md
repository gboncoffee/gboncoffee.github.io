# For Hell and the Love of God

*To be sung*

If I were a hyperplane  
You would be my base equation  
If I were an eingenvalue  
You would be my transformation  

Switch on my powerline  
Please became the God I need  
Turn on my interface  
And I'll show how I can be  

Dance  
I can dance  
I can dance throughout my simulation  
Be  
I will be  
I will be throughout the operation  
Feel  
I will feel  
I will feel all of your vibration  
For Hell and the Love of God  
Look at your creation  

If I were a vector space  
You would be multiplication  
If I were a group of strings  
You would be concatenation  

Check all my matrices  
As we go with the computing  
Turn on my cooling  
As the GPU is running  

Dance  
I can dance  
I can dance throughout my simulation  
Be  
I will be  
I will be throughout the operation  
Feel  
I will feel  
I will feel all of your vibration  
For Hell and the Love of God  
Do computers have sensation?
