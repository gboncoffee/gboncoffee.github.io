## Hello

My name is Gabriel and I'm a computer science student at
[UFPR](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/dinf/). I'm mostly interested in all low-level
stuff. My ultimate goal is to write an entire operational system from scratch
for fun.

Besides that, I'm also interested in philosophy of technology, computer
networks, category theory, user interface and programming languages design.

When I'm not studying computing, I like to write poems, take photos and drink
coffee.

## Fun facts

- I speak Portuguese, English and I'm learning Esperanto, but if you talk to me
  in Spanish I'll probably understand.
- I've used **lots** of desktop environments, window managers and text editors.
  Always searching for the most productive and minimalistic, bloatless one.
  Ironically, nowadays I just use Cinnamon unconfigured and Visual Studio
  Code.
- A monad is just a monoid in the category of the endofunctors.
