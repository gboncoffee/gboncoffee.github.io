Title. I would love to fall in love with Haskell, BUT...

...tooling.

Haskell is great. Compiled language with garbage collection. Extremelly
high-level: you will not make your OS with it, but you'll certainly make some
cool stuff. In a world of JavaScript, Python and Ruby, it's refreshing to have
a full compiled high-level language with static typing.

And I think functional programming is actually the future of high-level
programming. So I would love a functional language to make my high-level stuff.

But I'm here compiling my Haskell Language Server because if I install it
normally via `ghcup` it crashes because it misses a shared library in a random
directory inside my home folder. Like, wtf? How can you fuck up tooling like
that?

I could turn this post in a post about how dynamic linking is bad also, but now
I want to feel sad about how Haskell could literally be the perfect high-level
language if it's tooling wasn't so bad.
