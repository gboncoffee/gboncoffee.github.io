I listen to old school metal on my way home
This time in town, the parties just started
But my bus driver just wants to meet his wife
Back from the campus, I take an hour by bus
I see the other students drinking and kissing
As this liquid love spreads through the sewage
Maybe they know the future that I&rsquo;m studying"

    <p>At seven PM the pitch writing is the urban art<br>
I listen to old school metal on my way home<br>
This time in town, the parties just started<br>
But my bus driver just wants to meet his wife</p>
<p>Back from the campus, I take an hour by bus<br>
I see the other students drinking and kissing<br>
As this liquid love spreads through the sewage<br>
Maybe they know the future that I&rsquo;m studying</p>
<p>As the math that creates my music is computed<br>
It merges with the sound that the city produces<br>
Too much people are screaming of pain and love<br>
Their voices are muted when an ambulance passes</p>
<p>In this environment, we don&rsquo;t know who we are<br>
But I can ensure that we know who we want to be<br>
In this Cyber City, what connects us is a wire<br>
Even if you want to be a wireless human being</p>
