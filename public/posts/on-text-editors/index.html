</p>

                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Here, I&rsquo;ll talk a little about my journey with a lot of text editors and what
I&rsquo;m currently liking. Maybe I&rsquo;ll eventually try creating my own with the ideas
resumed here.</p>
<h1 id="on-text-editors">On Text Editors</h1>
<p>In my brief journey on computer programming - about three years right now - I
hopped text editor a lot. <em><strong>A lot</strong></em>.</p>
<p>My first text editor was
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html">IDLE</a>. It&rsquo;s an extremelly simple
text editor for Python written by Guido Van Rossum himself. It features syntax
highlighting, integrated repl and executing environment and probably more
features that I never used because I was a begginer. In retrospect, I like it&rsquo;s
simplicity.</p>
<p>I hopped to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">JetBrain&rsquo;s PyCharm</a> a few
months into learning programming. Back then, I was running a Windows laptop with
4gb of RAM and an Intel i3 (I still use this very same hardware, but with
another 8gb stick and Arch Linux). Of course, I was overhelmed with the
features, and it runned <em>terribly</em> slow. It was so painfull that I quitted
programming for about a month. Luckily, I got motivation again after I
discovered Linux, and switched my machine to Ubuntu. A few months using it, I
started using another JetBrains editor,
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>. It&rsquo;s very similar to PyCharm,
but for Java. At the time, I wasn&rsquo;t really understanding what I was doing, I
just kept using stuff I knew worked and though it was the way to go.</p>
<p>Eventually, I hopped to the nowadays everyone&rsquo;s favorite,
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio Code</a>. Still, it was
slow (<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HTML5-Golang-Desktop-Apps">Electron</a>) but
kinda manageable. At this point I was understanding something about what I was
doing, but not everything. I could compile a Java program from the terminal, I
knew how to manage files in the terminal, etc etc etc. And my hand was hurting a
lot because of the intense use of the mouse and the swap between it and the
keyboard.</p>
<p>So I learned about the most loved one, <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. I switched
to it in a gradual fashion. Of course, I haven&rsquo;t documented the extremelly
extensive history of adding and removing plugins, switching to
<a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, switching back to plain Vim, etc etc etc. When I
was in a more minimalist phase, I removed plugins, and vice-versa. I learned a
lot about everything related to computers and computer programming during that
period.</p>
<p>I was using a very customized Neovim with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">LSP</a> and
<a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">TreeSitter-based</a> syntax
highlighting and all those fancy stuff that slowed it down, when I learned about
<a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix</a>. I switched to it because it had almost
everything I had in Neovim with almost no configuration. It hadn&rsquo;t a plugin that
I wrote to Neovim, tho: <a href="https://github.com/gboncoffee/run.lua">run.lua</a>. I like
compile-driven development, so not having to switch to another
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> pane, pressing the up key, enter and them
figuring out where the previous compilation ended was very cool. Well, Helix
didn&rsquo;t had that and I couldn&rsquo;t add it as it does not have any extension system
(maybe this changed as you&rsquo;re reading). Anyways, I moved back to Neovim after
some time. Without LSP!</p>
<p>I always liked the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>. But I
didn&rsquo;t want to drop modal editing. Anyways, I switched to Emacs with
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil</a>, i.e., Vim emulation. I dropped about
a month latter because the input lag was painfull. And I wanted minimalism.</p>
<p>So, I switched to <a href="http://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>. I configured and liked it,
specially the editing model. It&rsquo;s very minimalist, and I liked. It had a <code>make</code>
wrapper similar to Emacs&rsquo; <code>compile-mode</code> that I always liked. Kakoune&rsquo;s, tho,
was simpler and not that usefull.</p>
<p>When I got into the university, colleagues convinced me to switch back to Vim. I
created a very simple configuration, and was kinda happy with it. But Vim always
felt like a bunch of improvisations to me. Some day, in the little middle-year
vacation, I tried Emacs with it&rsquo;s default keybinds. I got used to not having
modal editing very quickly. Emacs is almost a perfect environment. But it&rsquo;s
exactly that: a Lisp environment. Not a text editor. I&rsquo;m writing from it right
now.</p>
<p>So, if I&rsquo;m writing this, of course it means I&rsquo;m not very happy with
Emacs. Mainly, I think it&rsquo;s overcomplicated and - as I said - more like a Lisp
environment that should have been a text editor than a text editor.</p>
<p>Anyways, after this historical introduction, I&rsquo;ll talk about what I learned I
like and what I learned I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I readed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06030">On The Design of Text Editors</a> from
Nicolas Rougier. I don&rsquo;t agree with him in everything, but I liked the
overall. I don&rsquo;t like margins, and I think allowing the use of the mouse a
little more would be really great. Also, I don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s extensive use of
typesetting.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-highlighting-and-typesetting">Syntax Highlighting and Typesetting</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m very into
<a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/">no/minimal syntax highlighting</a>
and I kinda liked some ideas of
<a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/46a17205-e38c-44f9-b048-793c180c6e84">semantic highlighting</a>.
If I ever create a text editor, I&rsquo;ll probably just add code syntax for strings
and comments. Maybe no syntax at all. For Emacs and Vim, I created a color theme
that removes syntax except for strings and comments, it&rsquo;s called Cyber Cafe, for
<a href="https://github.com/gboncoffee/cybercafe-emacs-theme">Emacs</a> and for
<a href="https://github.com/gboncoffee/cybercafe-vim-theme">Vim</a>.</p>
<p>For markup languages, I really liked the idea of changing the typesetting
according. Of course, this is only proper achieved with font-size changes and
variable-pitch fonts when using a graphical text editor. And graphical text
editors are just better.</p>
<h2 id="keybinds">Keybinds</h2>
<p>I just want a great set that allows me to achieve everything via the keyboard
when I want, navigate fast and made edits fast without making my hands and
fingers tired. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s modal or not. Actually, probably Emacs
keybinds are the better for coding.</p>
<h2 id="the-mouse">The Mouse</h2>
<p>I liked the way <a href="https://plan9.io/plan9/">Plan 9 and Acme</a> graphical interfaces
work. I was into tilling window managers before, but nowadays I like using a
stacking one. What I&rsquo;m into is using the mouse for navigation sometimes, so
having a proper mouse support that uses all three buttons is great.</p>
<h2 id="other-utilities-and-integrations">Other Utilities And Integrations</h2>
<p>My text editor should also have a great file manager and a fast git UI. I do not
need a mail client, nor tetris, nor web browser, nor web server, nor dunnet, nor
an ELISA clone. It should have a great way to interact with all these utilities,
tho. In a beautiful Unix fashion.</p>
<p>My favorite feature of Emacs is the extremelly simple <code>compile-mode</code>. It allows
you to run a command fast, and parses compiler output for jumping between errors
and etc. This is really great, I really like it. My editor should have
first-class support for compilers. There&rsquo;s simply no reason to not have. And no,
LSP is not the way to go (I have no article to link here as this is just too
unpopular. I think I&rsquo;ll have to write something about that).</p>
<p>Not only compilers, but repls too! Integration with repls is very great, and I
like repl-driven development for languages like Haskell, Lisp, OCaml and Lua.</p>
<p>But, this does not mean an integrated terminal. The way to go is opening your
editor from within a terminal, and not the opposite. That terminal session
should be used to manage various other background jobs like web servers and
stuff.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Of course the editor should be graphical, but performance should be a
priority. I should be able to use it as my commit editor without feeling pain,
and opening it just for quick edits.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)">I guess we know the way to go</a>.</p>
