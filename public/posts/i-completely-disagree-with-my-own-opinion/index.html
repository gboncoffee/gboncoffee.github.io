                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>That&rsquo;s exactly it. I completely disagree with my own opinion!</p>
<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I wrote 3 blogposts about text editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gboncoffee.dev.br/posts/on-text-editors/">On text editors</a>, on which I wrote about my
text editor hopping journey and features I like (at the moment).</li>
<li><a href="http://gboncoffee.dev.br/posts/update-on-text-editors/">A Review On My Own Post On Text Editors</a>,
on which I wrote about the Unix philosophy, graphical desktops, modes of
editing and a bunch of other stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://gboncoffee.dev.br/posts/update-on-text-editors-again/">Another Update On Text Editors</a>, on
which I wrote about getting into <a href="https://plan9.io/plan9/">Plan 9 From Bell Labs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And I completely disagree with my opinion on those posts, so I&rsquo;ll address my new
philosophy here.</p>
<h2 id="from-arch-to-alpine-back-to-arch-and-them-fedora">From Arch to Alpine, back to Arch and them&hellip; Fedora?</h2>
<p>As I said in the previous post of this series, I really switched my main machine
to Alpine, due to minimalism philosophy. And it was terrible. I stayed with it
for sometime, until all the problems on living computing as it was the 90&rsquo;s
finally made me go back to an operating system with modern goodies.</p>
<p>So I went back to Arch as it was the system I knew. But man, it requires effort.</p>
<p>I already understood, while using Plan 9 software, that &ldquo;high customizability&rdquo;
isn&rsquo;t actually a good thing (I&rsquo;ll not evolve this, maybe I&rsquo;ll write a proper
argument and not a mere &ldquo;my experience&rdquo; sometime), but I was still a minimalist.
This time, though, I wanted something that just works and has the software I
need. So I installed Fedora. And I loved it.</p>
<p>I loved it because it just worked. GNOME is great, it just works, it&rsquo;s
efficient, and the interface does not create mental overhead on it&rsquo;s use. Yeah,
it wastes some resources. Ok, at least the keyring works, the network works, the
audio works, the bluetooth works. Everything I want just works and is easy to
use.</p>
<h2 id="ok-then-and-the-editor">Ok then, and the editor?</h2>
<p>I got myself thinking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">LSP</a>. I used to think
it was distracting, and just compiling after writing solved all the issues that
could be solved by LSP. But what I noticed is that when I actually must not get
distracted, I&rsquo;m not coding: I&rsquo;m using pen and paper to figure out what I have to
code. And so LSP can actually be very useful for my workflow.</p>
<p>So I tried to use Emacs again. But I really did not like the way mouse works,
even with the menu bar enabled.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s that very popular editor with good LSP and mouse support&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah I went back to Visual Studio Code.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing more to comment on. It&rsquo;s very obvious why this is just
better than everything I was doing for the last years.</p>
<p>Oh, actually, there&rsquo;s one more thing to comment: I only have language plugins in
VS Code (except for GitHub Copilot). Default dark+ theme, no other plugins.</p>
