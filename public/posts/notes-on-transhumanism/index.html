  <content>
    <p>In the sense that language and fire were there before the evolving of
the <em>Homo sapiens</em>, the species was enhanced by technology since
it’s beggining. There’s a sense that technology itself is a part of
humans.</p>
<p>Humans, though, are self-described by their biological nature -
carbon-based material instances from the <em>Homo sapiens</em> species.
This is the sense that the technology is not a part of humans but rather
just a tool used to enhance their own lives.</p>
<p>However, as described in the first paragraph, the “<em>Homo
sapiens</em>-based humanity” itself only evolved after technology, with
it. There were never a sense of humankind without technology. And thus
we need to clarify the difference between the <em>Homo sapiens</em>
biological society and the bigger civilization we are constructing while
being humans.</p>
<p>Where and when this civilization started is not relevant for us, as
where and when exactly the first human was born. Both are rather long
transitioning processes between the unconscious,
clearly-not-our-civilization life-based society and a stage were we can
undoubtedly claim be part of our civilization. Also, we may discuss if
this bigger civilization started before or after <em>Homo sapiens</em>,
but that’s not relevant too.</p>
<p>From now on, I’ll call the civilization we live, that may have
started before the modern human species and may expand to other
carbon-or-not-based species or any other intelligent form that achieve
the citizen status of our civilization in the future, as just “our
civilization”.</p>
<p>So, if we achieve a status were our biological nature is irrelevant -
thus overcoming our humanity - i.e., transferring the dominant
intelligent creature form of the civilization from <em>Homo sapiens</em>
to another non-biological form, or even keeping our human bodies but
enhancing them to a level were their biological nature is irrelevant, we
achieved a “post-human”, or “trans-human” stage.</p>
<p>It’s important to notice that “enhancement” is generally defined only
for the civilization as a whole. This happens because there’s no clear
one that defines what is “enhancement” - multiple persons may have to
make this choice in multiple different situations. - In some cases, the
choice is individually made: if one chooses to take a medicine, one
considers it a technological enhancement. Other cases may be compulsory,
either by government - like vacination - or in an indirect manner - like
internet connection: you’re not mandated to have one, but most people
simply would be disabled to make financial transactions or apply for a
job without one, even though they may consider the internet a bad
technology.</p>
<p>When we consider civilization as a whole, though, we can define as
“enhancement” anything that either increases our rank in the Kardashev
scale - noticing that wasted energy, like the energy that
microprocessors liberate as heat, is not considered.</p>
<p>It’s also important to notice that it is not usefull to thing about
technological enhancements individually, as the concept of an individual
may be temporary. As our civilization is based on biological instances,
clearly separated from others, we currently have the concept of
“individual”. In the future, though, this concept may be overcomed and
the civilization may be just a single big instance. If you think this
does not make sense, notice how technology - specially computing - has
evolved in order to keep information synced between different human
brains across the globe.</p>
<p>Both the problem of “who chooses what is enhancement” and the
individual concept show that there are problems in our civilization that
aren’t solved by creating a new machine or something alike. A lot of
problems like hungry would be solvable with our technical level today,
but they aren’t because of politics (not just stuff that happens in the
state, but politics in general). If one does not view politics as a
technology - view with which I disagree - this would mean that
“technological enhancement” is not the only thing we need to use to
solve our problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s important to notice that using technological
enhancement to increase our rank in the Kardashev scale fast is not our
main goal. This should be repeated a lot of times to be clear. Incresing
our rank in the Kardashev scale fast using technological enhancement is
not our main goal. This happens because, as said before, we have the
concept of “individual” and our civilization is not centrally
controlled. This means that a lot of times some groups or individuals
may have conflict with others as they seek their own interests. It’s
clear for us that we should not sacrifice some individuals so the
civilization is enhanced. If we kept with increasing our rank fast as
our main goal without caring for the individual, very dangerous ideas
may arise, like eugenics. The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of
Human Rights is a great ethic parameter to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Besides that, those dangerous ideas probably would only produce harm
to our civilization in the long term, so they won’t actually increase
our rank. Probably, keeping with the goal of providing dignity for all
individuals via the welfare state and social democracy is the currently
most efficient way of increasing our rank in the long term.</p>
<p>As a resume: currently, the best way to seek for the post-human stage
is to help empowering individuals in overcoming their personal
disabilities - which can mean from helping solving hungry to creating
gadgets for blind and/or deaf people, passing through just generally
creating technology and solving people’s problems. Of course, this does
not mean that jobs that aren’t directly involved in the creation of
technology aren’t usefull for our goal. The creation of technology
depends directly and indirectly from virtually all jobs that exists in
our society nowadays.</p>
<p>It’s also important to notice that this does not mean that pure
science, human science, philosophy, entertainment and other work areas
that are tipically thrown in the “not usefull” group by a limited and
stupid common sense are actually usefull. Pure and human sciences and
philosophy are technology developments by themselves and they help our
civilization. Entertainment is also important as art and sports are also
technology and we need to have fun to be sane.</p>
<p>It’s clear for us that evolving our civilization is not a general
goal, in the sense that lots of people nowadays just does not care in
sacrificing other people to reach their personal goals.</p>
<p>Clearly, the mental technology - i.e., technology that is just idea
and/or information, like language or software and concepts like
ideologies, gender or behaviour - are the most difficult to develop.
That means that probably the greatest achivement of our civilization so
far is our rich language systems.</p>
<p>Clearly, pure biological beings have lots of disadvantages over
technologically-enhanced ones. Some political ideologies view the idea
of “overcoming the boundaries of the human species” as a bad thing. It’s
actually exactly what our civilization had been trying to do since the
evolving of the <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>
