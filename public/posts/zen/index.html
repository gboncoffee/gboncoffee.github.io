                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>1- No human being should have to perform a work if it can be done by a machine.</p>
<p>2- Although there is really no difference between humans and technology,
as technology is a fundamental part of the human condition.</p>
<p>3- Technology should be developed to overcome biological limitations of humans.</p>
<p>4- Thus, the pure humanism is contradictory, and the post-human stage of
development is a desired goal.</p>
<p>5- The developed technology should be used for Good, not for Evil.</p>
<p>6- Although is really not possible to control whether it will be used for
the Good, or whether it will be used for the Evil.</p>
<p>7- If technology development arises from Evil, or the fight against Evil
leads to technology development, so be it. The technology should still be
used, with no regrets nor limitations except it&rsquo;s use, that should be for Good.</p>
<p>8- Tools have an intrinsic, generic use case. They may be used for something
else, if possible, but they always carry their intrinsic use case.</p>
<p>9- Thus, the interface of a piece of technology should empower the User to
perfom it&rsquo;s intrinsic, generic use case. No more, no less.</p>
<p>10- Although it may adapt for the specific use case and individuality of
it&rsquo;s User.</p>
<p>11- In the case it has to adapt, the more adaptative with the less
configuration, the better.</p>
<p>12- A solution may only use it&rsquo;s required resources, and reduce it&rsquo;s
requirements is a desired goal.</p>
<p>13- Although unused resources are also wasted.</p>
<p>14- In the case resources are idling, they may be used to a purpouse that
does not waste them. As stocks, for example.</p>
<p>15- Technology should be developed in a sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>16- Thus, the thirteenth guideline should be wisely followed to not lead to
the Evil.</p>
<p>17- If a piece of technology can not be held accountable, it&rsquo;s failure is
a human error.</p>
<p>18- When a piece of technology may be held accountable, it should become a
citizen of Our Civilization.</p>
<p>19- Although you may not like that if you&rsquo;re religious enough.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-a-computer-and-program-design">Appendix A: Computer and Program Design</h2>
<p>A.1- Computing is Art. Treat it accordingly.</p>
<p>A.2- Linked-lists are great for the Programmer.</p>
<p>A.3- Although they&rsquo;re not great for the Machine.</p>
<p>A.4- The same applies for abstractions and functional programming.</p>
<p>A.5- Convention is great. It leads to Cohesion and Coherence.</p>
<p>A.6- Although a bad Convention is often worse than no Convention at all.</p>
<p>A.7- Systems should not hide themselves. Hiding a Lion System in a Feline
abstraction may lead the Programmer to think it&rsquo;s actually a Cat.</p>
<p>A.8- Or worse, it may lead the User to think it&rsquo;s just Magic.</p>
<p>A.9- Programmers often implement more and more generic features than they
should, just because they can. This should be avoided.</p>
<p>A.10- One way to address this issue is giving less power to them.</p>
<p>A.11- Although this should be done wisely to not lead to featureless Systems.</p>
<p>A.12- Simplicity and Minimalism should be used with little moderation.</p>
<p>A.13- Although you may not know how much is little moderation unless you
program in Go.</p>
<p>A.14- The Instruction Set Architeture should be simple enough so the Student
can program in it&rsquo;s Assembly.</p>
<p>A.15- Syntax does matter, but Semantics are much more important.</p>
<p>A.16- Different Things should be visibly different.</p>
<p>A.17- Important Things should be quickly accessible, and important Information
should be visible. Similarly, non-important Things and Information should
be hidden, but accessible when needed.</p>
<p>A.18- A Computer should minimize the amount of computing the brain of the
User must do.</p>
<p>A.19- Don&rsquo;t forget the Joy of Computing.</p>
