                <p>Original post (base + Appendix A): 2024-02-21T17:45:36-03:00<br>
Appendix B and C: 2024-09-19T22:39:33-03:00</p>
<p>1- No human being should have to perform a work if it can be done by a machine.</p>
<p>2- Although there is really no difference between humans and technology,
as technology is a fundamental part of the human condition.</p>
<p>3- Technology should be developed to overcome biological limitations of humans.</p>
<p>4- Thus, the pure humanism is contradictory, and the post-human stage of
development is a desired goal.</p>
<p>5- The developed technology should be used for Good, not for Evil.</p>
<p>6- Although is really not possible to control whether it will be used for
the Good, or whether it will be used for the Evil.</p>
<p>7- If technology development arises from Evil, or the fight against Evil
leads to technology development, so be it. The technology should still be
used, with no regrets nor limitations except it&rsquo;s use, that should be for Good.</p>
<p>8- Tools have an intrinsic, generic use case. They may be used for something
else, if possible, but they always carry their intrinsic use case.</p>
<p>9- Thus, the interface of a piece of technology should empower the User to
perfom it&rsquo;s intrinsic, generic use case. No more, no less.</p>
<p>10- Although it may adapt for the specific use case and individuality of
it&rsquo;s User.</p>
<p>11- In the case it has to adapt, the more adaptative with the less
configuration, the better.</p>
<p>12- A solution may only use it&rsquo;s required resources, and reduce it&rsquo;s
requirements is a desired goal.</p>
<p>13- Although unused resources are also wasted.</p>
<p>14- In the case resources are idling, they may be used to a purpouse that
does not waste them. As stocks, for example.</p>
<p>15- Technology should be developed in a sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>16- Thus, the thirteenth guideline should be wisely followed to not lead to
the Evil.</p>
<p>17- If a piece of technology can not be held accountable, it&rsquo;s failure is
a human error.</p>
<p>18- When a piece of technology may be held accountable, it should become a
citizen of Our Civilization.</p>
<p>19- Although you may not like that if you&rsquo;re religious enough.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-a-computer-and-program-design">Appendix A: Computer and Program Design</h2>
<p>A.1- Computing is Art. Treat it accordingly.</p>
<p>A.2- Linked-lists are great for the Programmer.</p>
<p>A.3- Although they&rsquo;re not great for the Machine.</p>
<p>A.4- The same applies for abstractions and functional programming.</p>
<p>A.5- Convention is great. It leads to Cohesion and Coherence.</p>
<p>A.6- Although a bad Convention is often worse than no Convention at all.</p>
<p>A.7- Systems should not hide themselves. Hiding a Lion System in a Feline
abstraction may lead the Programmer to think it&rsquo;s actually a Cat.</p>
<p>A.8- Or worse, it may lead the User to think it&rsquo;s just Magic.</p>
<p>A.9- Programmers often implement more and more generic features than they
should, just because they can. This should be avoided.</p>
<p>A.10- One way to address this issue is giving less power to them.</p>
<p>A.11- Although this should be done wisely to not lead to featureless Systems.</p>
<p>A.12- Simplicity and Minimalism should be used with little moderation.</p>
<p>A.13- Although you may not know how much is little moderation unless you
program in Go.</p>
<p>A.14- The Instruction Set Architeture should be simple enough so the Student
can program in it&rsquo;s Assembly.</p>
<p>A.15- Syntax does matter, but Semantics are much more important.</p>
<p>A.16- Different Things should be visibly different.</p>
<p>A.17- Important Things should be quickly accessible, and important Information
should be visible. Similarly, non-important Things and Information should
be hidden, but accessible when needed.</p>
<p>A.18- A Computer should minimize the amount of computing the brain of the
User must do.</p>
<p>A.19- Don&rsquo;t forget the Joy of Computing.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-b-computer-programming">Appendix B: Computer Programming</h2>
<p>B.1- The only programmers that should care about typing fast are those who race
coding, program in Java or earn more for coding more lines of Code.</p>
<p>B.2- Although if you&rsquo;re one of the last two, you may want to rethink your Life
Choices.</p>
<p>B.3- Usually, there&rsquo;s Something wrong if Programming does not bring Joy.</p>
<p>B.4- And it should be noted that Something may be wrong outside the Code.</p>
<p>B.5- You should understand what a certain Piece of Code is doing, even if it&rsquo;s
doing it wrong.</p>
<p>B.6- And if a Piece of Code is doing Something right and you don&rsquo;t understand
how, the Code is wrong anyways.</p>
<p>B.7- Thus, understanding what Code is doing is the most important Thing in
Programming.</p>
<p>B.8- When Programming, no Problems are solved in the Text Editor.</p>
<p>B.9- They&rsquo;re solved in the Paper, with a Pen or Pencil.</p>
<p>B.10- Thus, it&rsquo;s important to know when to leave the Computer and get the Paper.</p>
<p>B.11- Computer Programming is no manual Art, it&rsquo;s an Intellectual one. Treat it
accordingly.</p>
<p>B.12- Computer Programming is also part of Maths. Although some People may be
triggered by this Statement.</p>
<p>B.13- You don&rsquo;t need to know the inner workings of Something, except when you
need.</p>
<p>B.14- You&rsquo;re never smarter then Compilers, Libraries, Frameworks or any other
example of Code wrote before you, except when you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>B.15- And you would be surprised if you knew how many times you&rsquo;re wittier than
you think.</p>
<p>B.16- Also because Context-specific Information is very Powerful.</p>
<p>B.17- To Program a Computer is more to Read then to Write. It&rsquo;s better to spend
2 hours reading Cormen or Knuth and 1 hour Programming Something than the same 3
hours just Programming that exactly same Something.</p>
<p>B.18- Although the authors should be carefully choosed, and they must not
include Robert Cecil Martin.</p>
<p>B.19- None of the Statements above will do Anything if you don&rsquo;t go Code
Something.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-c-programming-in-the-c-programming-language">Appendix C: Programming in The C Programming Language</h2>
<p>C.1- If you have the slightliest Idea of how you would implement a certain Piece
of Code in Assembly, that Piece of Code is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>C.2- Although the Compiler may generate Something completely different.</p>
<p>C.3- The Compiler should not be fought, as he is a Friend.</p>
<p>C.4- <code>$ find . -name &quot;*.[c,h]&quot; -exec clang-format -i {} \;</code>.</p>
<p>C.5- C is not a Strongly typed Programming Language.</p>
<p>C.6- Although it&rsquo;s a Static one, and that must be well used.</p>
<p>C.7- <code>-ansi -pedantic</code> builds a good Ethos.</p>
<p>C.8- Memory is the most important Thing always. More than your spouse.</p>
<p>C.9- If you cannot be sure of how many times a certain <code>malloc()</code> will be called
in a specific Place, that Place should not have a call to <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
<p>C.10- The Stack is a Friend. Use it wisely.</p>
<p>C.11- &ldquo;The C Programming Language&rdquo; is our Bible. K&amp;R are our Prophets. C is no
Science, but Religion.</p>
<p>C.12- Thus, understanding it is a Religious Process.</p>
<p>C.13- Use the Debugger when in doubt and when not.</p>
<p>C.14- Don&rsquo;t be afraid to do Something by hand or use a Forbidden Technique,
except if your Professor will give you a worse grade for it.</p>
<p>C.15- Learn before you type and understand before you compile.</p>
<p>C.16- If dealing with Memory Problems, <code>goto C.8;</code>.</p>
<p>C.17- No one likes Programming in C. We aim to kill it Soon.</p>
<p>C.18- Although we&rsquo;re still Programming in C, and our Environments are still
depending on it.</p>
<p>C.19- C is dead. Long live C!</p>
