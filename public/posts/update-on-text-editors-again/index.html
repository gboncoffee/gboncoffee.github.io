                <h1 id="or-how-i-got-into-the-nerdiest-thing-ever--rant-on-modern-unix">(or How I Got Into The Nerdiest Thing Ever + Rant On Modern Unix)</h1>
<p>Some weeks ago I wrote <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/on-text-editors/">a blogpost</a> about my journey on
text editor hopping, and them <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/update-on-text-editors/">another blogpost</a>
reviewing my own post. Well, here we go again.</p>
<p>In the last post I wrote about Plasma and the Unix philosophy in the desktop but
that&rsquo;s mostly bullshit. And that&rsquo;s why the Linux desktop is a mess.</p>
<p>Instead of the original Unix idea of multiple programs writing text to others,
the Linux desktop is based on other APIs like the X server itself, dbus and
etc.␣And often they don&rsquo;t talk the same language. QT vs GTK is an example of
this, alongside with desktop portals, notification daemons, etc.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&rsquo;t happy with Plasma&rsquo;s design philosophy because of bloat. I tried
GNOME but it&rsquo;s worse. End up on XFCE.</p>
<p>XFCE is better as it&rsquo;s simple and minimal. But I really wanted to go back to
using window managers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>What I found out is that, in the end, what I really care about is having a sane
and cohesive shell (using &ldquo;shell&rdquo; as &ldquo;interface&rdquo;). Plasma is a kinda cohesive
graphical shell, but it&rsquo;s not that efficient. Menu-bar-driven, two-button mouse
systems, i.e., the modern graphical paradigm popularized by the Microsoft
Windows operating system, is not efficient.</p>
<p>One could argue that the Unix terminal is more efficient, but I found it very
incohesive. First, the shell language is a mess. Second, the command argument
syntaxes are very diverse. Third, the ANSI terminal itself. It&rsquo;s an ancient hack
that stick with us and should&rsquo;ve been dropped when graphical interfaces became
popular. We&rsquo;d never implemented simple graphics API though so the result is that
it&rsquo;s 2023 and we&rsquo;re still using curses. Also, modern Unix got a lot of stuff
wrong, mainly due to the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project push
towards the bloat. Much GNU documentation is acessible via the <code>info</code> pages that
nobody really knows how to read, some commands have a <code>--help</code>, some have the
manual (which is much better than any other alternative, <em>specially</em> <code>info</code>
pages). And the manual opens inside the pager with a broken view in my terminal
because it doesn&rsquo;t support bold.</p>
<p>And them we got Emacs. Emacs is actually a very cohesive shell, but it&rsquo;s
painfully slow and it&rsquo;s not particularly efficient. It&rsquo;s probably the least
painfull way to use the GNU system &ldquo;the way it was intented&rdquo; nowadays, which is
kinda funny because Emacs is it&rsquo;s own containeirized Lisp operating system.</p>
<p>Wandering through the web, I read some Rob Pike&rsquo;s papers and found out the
nerdiest thing in computing: <a href="https://plan9.io/plan9/">Plan 9 From Bell Labs</a>.
It&rsquo;s almost perfect. The graphical shell is extremelly efficient, the mouse
usage is geniously simple and easy, yet fast. The entire system is very simple
and straighforward. So much that I had the Plan 9 From User Space port installed
in my Debian system and in a couple hours I had learned everything I had to
learn to be as efficient as I&rsquo;m after years of learning Unix with my new shell
and toys.</p>
<p>Acme is specially a rather efficient shell. And, different from the hack that&rsquo;s
the graphical Emacs, it was meant to be a shell. Everything is so cool that I&rsquo;ll
be changing to a very minimalistic Unix system -
<a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">Alpine</a>, so I can have everything in busybox and
statically linked with musl - and using basically the Plan 9 tools and other
minimalistic software to do my computing. I liked Plan 9 so much that I&rsquo;m
writing my own <code>rio</code> clone for X11.</p>
<p>And I know exactly what I liked in it. Basically, the system allows, via the
mouse, easy and free exchanging of text between different programs, running in
parallel in the graphical environment, with a cohesive interface. It&rsquo;s possible
to create such shell for Unix, but it would be a rather difficult task. Much
difficultier than for Plan 9 as there would be no support from the system
itself. I may try it though.</p>
