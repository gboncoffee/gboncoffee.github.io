<h1>Letter From a Child of The Internet</h1>
<p>I was born the year Facebook was created. A child of the internet and the globalized world. From the rise of Latin-Americanism, they brought me to the interconnected planet. I was an alien to the terrorist groups of the Middle-East. Somehow, after twenty five years of millennium, their existence directly affects my life. I was an alien to everything outside my third-world. Somehow, beginning the second quarter of the century, every corner of the planet directly affects my life.</p>
<p>So few years on this Earth have I ever seen, I don’t know if it has changed a lot ever since. The climate isn’t the same, and people’s behavior neither. How much of it was normal, and how much was unusual? It’s my first time trying to be an adult, so I don’t know any other way.</p>
<p>Inside my mind, English and my mother tongue mix together. Portuguese is only to be spoken with the people around me - a dying habit at this point to be fair. Most of the time is to be spend in the foreign language, passively reading or listening virtual people. Shall I celebrate the union of the nations in a single network in the same language?</p>
<p>Daily I communicate with so much people any human in other time would be jealous. But it seems so hard to actually make new friends - and dates. Some have suggested me to use dating apps. Maybe I’m not so progressive as I thought, because that idea freaks me out. What if I met someone I actually know there? Is that profit? Why can’t we just date offline? I don’t know how it was before, so maybe shall I just accept how the situation presents itself to me.</p>
<p>Family members are militants for the interests of terrorist sponsors states and they don’t even realize. On the other side, those who say are combating toxicity are blaming people whose only mistake was loving someone too much. If I said I was feeling lonely, in part it’s my fault: I seek to be alone much more after I see all of this.</p>
<p>A letter from a medium human in every possible aspect, member of the zoomer generation, confused about where they belongs, written 8773 days after the beginning of the third millennium.</p>
