        <!-- en :: YouTube Autotranslation Considered Harmful :: 2025-06-02 13:09:11 -->
<p>I'm a bilingual person. I was born and still live in Brazil, and so I speak
natively brazilian Portuguese. I had the opportunity to study English and now,
as I'm 20, I can understand and talk in it rather well: to the point where if I
do not speak much with anyone, I'll have used more English than Portuguese
during my day.</p>
<p>English is my &quot;work&quot; language: my computer is set to English. I usually study
computing in English. I hang out in English forums and social networks. And I
watch YouTube in English.</p>
<p>But I also watch it in Portuguese.</p>
<p>I guess no one in that company knows that bilingual people exist, because
YouTube automatically translates the titles of the Portuguese videos I watch to
English, and it started automatically dubbing those videos too, so instead of
playing a video and beeing greeted by the content creator speaking Portuguese,
I'm greeted by an AI speaking English.</p>
<p>The translation is not good, ever. Translation itself will always lose meaning.
This is of course much worse when you have a broken translation. I wonder what
the person that though of this feature was thinking. To be fair, I wonder if
they think at all, because this is so fucking stupid it's comical.</p>
<p>You cannot simply tell YouTube to stop doing this. No, it's forced up on you.
Actually, if you play a video with no text in the thumbnail, you won't know
if you're reading and listening the original or a translation (hoping they won't
put this feature in thumbnails also!). And that's dangerous. They're literally
putting words on creator's mouth's.</p>
<p>The translation is so bad,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1kjndo3/what_is_the_point_of_forcing_translated_titles/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it does not recognize dialects</a>.
And you shouldn't be defending this feature by saying that &quot;the target audience
is monolingual people&quot; because 1) so we should be allowed to disable it, and 2)
I only properly speak 2 languages, there's infinitely more I don't. And if a
video is not available with good subtitles in the 2 languages I do speak, I
won't be using autotranslation to watch it because I know I won't be listening
or reading the creator.</p>
<p>You wouldn't autodub a Netflix show. Actually, most people watch shows in the
original with subtitles in their language. Because that's the way to go if you
want to understand it. Entonation tells you a lot, and autodubbing loses that.</p>
