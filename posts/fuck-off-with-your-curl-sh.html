      <!-- Fuck Off With Your `curl | sh` :: 2024-09-27 23:24:06 -->
<h1>Fuck Off With Your <code>curl | sh</code></h1>
<p>Fuck off with your <code>curl something something something | sh</code> to install your
tool.</p>
<p>And this is not about security. I trust HTTPS. I trust you. But I want to know
<strong>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WITH MY SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO READ A FUCKING
BASH SCRIPT IN A RANDOM URL</strong>. I just want to know how the installation of your
tool work. What should be done to get your tool installed. Where are the paths?
Which binaries?</p>
<p>Long story short, I was going to install &quot;GHCup&quot; which is a manager for Haskell
or something, and the website told me to do a <code>curl | sh</code> to do shit in my
system and have a <code>ghcup</code> command working. Fortunatelly, they had a link which
read &quot;I don't like <code>curl | sh</code>&quot; right below the command line. I clicked it and
it read something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Manual installation for Unix</h3>
<p>Download the binary from https://somewhere and put in your goddamn <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>DO YOU THINK I'M WHAT? FIVE?</h2>
<p>Do you fucking think I cannot understand how to download a fucking binary and
put somewhere in my <code>$PATH</code>? <strong>JUST SAY TO ME FOR YOUR TOOL TO WORK I JUST NEED
1 (ONE) UNIT OF <code>ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV)</code> SOMEWHERE
IN THE FUCKING <code>$PATH</code>. I DON'T NEED A FUCKING BASH SCRIPT TO DO THAT.</strong></p>
<p>Hell. That's why I like the <code>go</code> installation. They just say it to you: unpack
the release somewhere. Put <code>somewhere/bin</code> in your <code>$PATH</code>. Now I know
everything that's happening on my system. Fuck.</p>
<p>I'm not even doing the installation. I'm going to sleep, it's almost midnight at
UTC-3. Tomorrow I'll maybe download your goddamn ELF.</p>
