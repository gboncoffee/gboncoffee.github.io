      <!-- Stupid Sorting :: 2023-09-12 10:02:53 -->
<h1>Stupid Sorting</h1>
<p>The first topic in &quot;Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados II&quot; (&quot;Algorithms and Data
Structures II&quot;) classes are sorting algorithms. The first one we learn is the
stupid Selection Sort. It's not really that usefull but it's a great example to
learn. Then we learn stuff like the Insertion Sort, which's actually usefull and
more complex to understand.</p>
<p>But, as stupid as Selection Sort is, it's kinda straightforward. What about some
really, really stupid and useless sorting algorithms?</p>
<p>For this algorithms I used some <code>#includes</code> and a simple function that checks if
an array is sorted. The entire source is available
<a href="https://gist.github.com/gboncoffee/2ecfacb0bc7f03626e4c1d2e4d00253f">here at GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Kill Sort</h2>
<p>Sorts the array by removing unsorted itens. Returns the final size.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int kill_sort(int *v, int n)
{
	int pad = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) {
		if (v[i] &lt; v[i - 1 - pad])
			pad++;
		else
			v[i - pad] = v[i];
	}

	return n - pad;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The cool thing about this one is that it keeps the pointer valid. Of course,
it's usefull if we want a sorted array but don't need all the elements. It's
linear too, which is very cheap, but it writes a lot, and that's not great if
writes are expensive.</p>
<h2>Thanos Sort</h2>
<p>Sorts the array by removing a random half of it until it's sorted. Returns the
final array pointer and sets n to it's size.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int* thanos_sort(int *v, int *n)
{
	srand(time(NULL));
	while (*n &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; !sorted(v, *n)) {
		if (random() % 2) {
			v += *n / 2;
		}

		*n = *n / 2;
	}

	return v;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Very similar to Kill Sort. Unfortunatelly, this one leads to much more data loss
and does not have predictable behaviour. But it does not make a single write in
the array and runs in logarithmic time. Extremelly cheap. Also, it may not keep
the pointer valid, and that's why it returns a new one. This should be used with
caution to not cause memory leaks.</p>
<h2>Random Sort</h2>
<p>Sorts the array by randomizing a sequence and them checking if it's sorted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void random_sort(int *v, int n)
{
	int x, y, tmp;
	srand(time(NULL));
	while (!sorted(v, n)) {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
			x = random() % n;
			y = random() % n;
			tmp = v[x];
			v[x] = v[y];
			v[y] = tmp;
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This one is fun. It has a little chance of sorting the array in a single
iteration. I tested with an array with 10 elements and it usuallys takes between
300 thousand and 700 thousand iterations to finish. As it have a chance of
running a single iteration, it have a chance of never sorting at all too.</p>
<h2>Intelligent Design Sort</h2>
<p>Sorts the array by the following principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's n! chance of the array being sorted;</li>
<li>So it must have been sorted by an intelligent designer.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-c">void intelligent_design_sort(int *v, int n)
{
	(void) v;
	(void) n;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the cheapest algorithm here. Runs in constant time and uses only a
single stack frame of memory <em>at all, without compiler optimization</em>. I've only
ever saw very few functions cheapest than this in computer science, and they're
usually not usefull at all.</p>
<h2>Miracle Sort</h2>
<p>Sorts the array by waiting and hoping cosmic rays are going to flip the memory
so the array get's sorted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void miracle_sort(int *v, int n)
{
	while (!sorted(v, n))
		sleep(5);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah it just sits there and patiently waits for a miracle. You can adjust the
sleep time to change the behaviour of the algorithm: more time will lead to a
slightly slower sort, but less CPU usage. Less time will lead to a slightly
faster sort, but more CPU usage.</p>
<h2>Schrodinger Sort</h2>
<p>It's not sorted nor unsorted until you check it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int schrodinger_sort(int *v, int n)
{
	return sorted(v, n);
}
</code></pre>
<p>It sorts the array by telling you if it's sorted or not, so you decides what to
do. Quantum mechanics are really cool, aren't they?</p>
